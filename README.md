# My-Tamagotchi-App
Overview
Welcome to the Tamagotchi app, a virtual pet simulation based on the well-known Tamagotchi toy from the 1990s. With the help of this software, Android users may interact and take care of their virtual pet in a manner similar to that of the real toy. 
Features
Feeding: To maintain the health and happiness of their virtual pet, users can feed it. 

Cleaning: In order to preserve their pet's hygiene, owners should clean up after them. 

Playing: To keep their pet happy and entertained, owners can play with them. 

Status Monitoring: Based on user activities and over time, the app updates the health, hunger, and hygiene statuses of the pet. 

Design Considerations
User Interface: To provide a distinctive experience, the app's interface uses bespoke colors, fonts, and visual components to make it engaging and user friendly.
Pet Images: The user's interactions (feeding, cleaning, playing, etc.) cause the pet's picture to change dynamically, improving the visual feedback and immersion.

GitHub and GitHub Actions: Version control, teamwork, and automation are made possible by GitHub Actions, which are available for use with projects maintained using Git that are hosted on GitHub.
GitHub Repository
The source code for the Tamagotchi app is available in the following GitHub repository: 
My-Tamagotchi-App/ at main · TaahirH7/My-Tamagotchi-App (github.com)
Utilization of GitHub and GitHub Actions
Version Control: Git version control and GitHub hosting provide effective collaboration and code change tracking for the project.

GitHub Actions: GitHub Actions workflows are used for the app's automated testing and construction. The app's dependability and stability in a variety of settings are guaranteed by continuous integration.
Manual Testing
Extensive manual testing has been carried out to guarantee the seamless operation of the application, encompassing all user interactions and transitions. It is confirmed that the pet's status values appropriately reflect user activities and gradually decline to reflect the pet's needs.

Automated Testing
GitHub Actions is used to include automated testing into the development cycle. With each push to the repository, the given YAML file specifies the processes for creating the application, executing tests, and automatically producing reports.
